# popular-sort-algorithms
Most popular sort algorithms implement by Python3

|               |  Insertion  |    Bubble   |  Selection  |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Comparisions: |             |             |             |
| Best Case     | O(n)        | O(n^2)      | O(n^2)      |
| Average Case  | O(n^2)      | O(n^2)      | O(n^2)      |
| Worst Case    | O(n^2)      | O(n^2)      | O(n^2)      |
| Swap:         |             |             |             |
| Best Case     | 0           | 0           | O(n)        |
| Average Case  | O(n^2)      | O(n^2)      | O(n)        |
| Worst Case    | O(n^2)      | O(n^2)      | O(n)        |

There are a few key elements to each algorithm:
*conceptually how it works
*code implementation
*time complexity
*space complexity
*stability of results
